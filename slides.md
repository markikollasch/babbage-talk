- Designed for arithmetic
- Nobody could estimate expense of construction
- Nobody could verify whether it would work

> On two occasions I have been asked, - "Pray, Mr. Babbage, <span style="color: #42affa; font-weight: bold;">if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?</span>" In one case a member of the Upper, and in the other a member of the Lower, House put this question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.

- Think about that
- For devs, trivial to say computer will do what it's told

# Which of these is the right question?
- The question the machine interpreted
- The question the user asked
- The question the user intended to ask
- The question the user implied
- The question the user did not know they needed to ask
- The question whose answer will solve the user's problem

<div class="notes">
- What question shall we answer?
- Increasing order of inconvenience and value
- Programs should help us think
- But do not relieve us of the responsibility of thinking
